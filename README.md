Gemini AI Chatbot 🤖

This is a simple AI chatbot web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of integrating Google’s Gemini AI.
The project focuses on creating a basic chat interface where users can type messages and receive AI-generated responses.

This project is mainly for learning and practice, especially for understanding how AI APIs can be connected with a web interface.

About the Project

The idea behind this project is to build a chatbot similar to ChatGPT, but powered by Gemini AI.
Right now, the project includes the frontend UI for the chatbot and is ready to be connected with the Gemini API.

It’s a good starting point if you want to explore:

How AI chat interfaces work

How to connect APIs with JavaScript

How to structure a small AI-based web project

Features

Simple and clean chatbot UI

User input and AI response layout

Frontend built without frameworks

Easy to understand and modify

Ready for Gemini API integration

Note: This is currently a frontend-only project. AI responses will work once the Gemini API is properly connected.

Tech Stack

HTML – Structure of the chatbot

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Chat logic and API handling

No backend is included yet.

Project Structure

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/avy2025/Gemini-AI-Chatbot.git


Open the project folder

Open Gemni index.html in your browser

That’s it. The chatbot UI will load.

How to Make It Work with Gemini AI

To get real AI responses:

Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio

Add the API key in your JavaScript file

Send user messages to the Gemini model and display the response in the chat UI

⚠️ For security reasons, it’s better to connect the API through a backend instead of exposing the key in frontend code.

Future Improvements

Some things that can be added later:

Backend integration (Node.js / Python)

Secure API handling

Chat history

Better UI/UX

Dark mode

Voice input support

Why This Project?
