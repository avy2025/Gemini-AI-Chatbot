# GitHub Repository Setup Guide 🚀

To remove the "No description or topics" warning and make your project look professional, follow these steps to add metadata to your GitHub repository.

## 1. Add Description & Website
A good description helps people understand what your project does at a glance.

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** icon (gear) in the "About" section on the right-hand side.
3. Fill in the **Description**:
   > "A clean and modern AI chatbot web application powered by Google's Gemini AI API. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
4. (Optional) If you have it deployed (e.g., on GitHub Pages), add the **Website** URL.

## 2. Add Topics
Topics make your repository discoverable. Add the following tags in the "Topics" section:

- `gemini-api`
- `ai-chatbot`
- `google-gemini`
- `javascript`
- `html5`
- `css3`
- `chatbot`
- `frontend`
- `web-app`

## 3. Professional README
We have already updated your `README.md` to be structured and professional. Ensure it includes:
- [x] Clear title and description
- [x] Feature list
- [x] Installation instructions
- [x] Screenshots/Gifs (optional but recommended)
- [x] License information

## 4. GitHub Actions (Optional)
If you want to automate testing or deployment, check out the `.github/workflows` folder.
